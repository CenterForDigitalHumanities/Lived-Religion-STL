                Lived Religion in the Digital Age is a new initiative in the Department of Theological Studies at Saint Louis University directed by Dr. Rachel Lindsey and Dr. Pauline Lee. The project is funded through a Henry Luce Foundation grant on Advancing Public Scholarship on Religion and Theology. We aim to further academic and civic understanding of religion through the production of digital publications and resources, public forums and performances, art exhibits, publicly engaged research, and academic conferences.

                “Think of civic events and places - Festival of Nations in Tower Grove Park, the Gateway Arch, baseball
                at Busch Stadium, even protesting and voting - and we don't usually think ‘religion', but what we are
                finding is that people are making connections
                between their religious lives and the city all the time. And that even people who don't identify as
                religious are often shaped by the religious histories and cultures of the city.” - Rachel Lindsey, Ph.D.

                “We are hoping to push the edge of what is currently available by mapping the diversity of religious faiths
                within St. Louis and its history and create a database of scholarship.” - Pauline Lee, Ph.D.
