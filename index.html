                Seek to better understand religion in American public life in collaboration with members of local
                communities representing diverse traditions, histories, and practices. Attend to sounds, sights, and
                spaces, as well as to teachings and texts. Our research team has built a robust multisensory
                inventory of religion as it is lived in the complex realities of modern life in St. Louis, Missouri.
